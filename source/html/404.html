{#
 # 404 template
 # ------------
 #
 # This template is loaded whenever Craft cannot figure out how to
 # respond to an incoming request. No setup is involved to get your
 # 404 page working; you just need to call it 404.html and put it
 # at the root of your craft/templates/ folder.
 #
 # See this page for more details on how Craft routes requests:
 # http://craftcms.com/docs/routing
 #}

  <p>What’s worse, a hilarious 404 page can’t be found either.</p>
